Among different areas where artifcial intelligence driven techniques can be used, urban planning is one of the most interesting one provided its relevance in big city like Chicago. 
The problems in urban planning can range from traffic congestion control to smart utlity pricing. The task I'd like to tackle is improvment of public transportation system. The goal is to apply data-driven AI techniques to optimize the bus
schedule given the traffic patterns and anticipated bus passenger volume. We can use the historical data for passenger flow in a particular route at any given time of the day, and also the traffic density for different parts of the city.
For passenger flow prediction we can can use any time series prediction model. These range from classical approach like ARIMA to modern deep learning based methods like LSTM. Mean Absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 
one of the metric used to measure error of the forecasting model.
